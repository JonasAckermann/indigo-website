## Snake

At various points in Indigo's development, little games and examples have been made. One of the earliest complete, albeit simple games, was an implementation of Snake.

Although the code is originally several years old and possibly not what the authors would do now if they were starting again, the code base has nonetheless been kept up to date. Snake has been part of Indigo's standard build process for a long time now, helping us ensure we haven't broken anything!

The code is freely accessible for you to use as reference as the following location:

## Working feature examples

Also as part of indigo's build, exists a suite of examples:

These allow us to quickly check individual features in a simple way. They aren't always glamourous, but they are handy for reference!
