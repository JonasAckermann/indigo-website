# Indigo

Are you a Scala developer? Does writing 2D modern-retro games for the browser* in a purely functional style, exclusively using WebGL 2.0 (Argh! Browser compatibility!), using a code-only engine with no editor sound like your idea of a good time? Then Indigo might just possibly be the game engine you've been looking for!

*(\* we hope to add more platforms in the future!)*

## Alternatives to Indigo

If Indigo isn't quite doing it for you, here are some possible alternatives to help you get your game dev fix:

**Scala!** - The only alternative Scala game engine at the time of writing is [SGL (Scala Game Library)](https://github.com/regb/scala-game-library).

**Code-only!** - If you're looking for a code only engine, try [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) with something like [Heaps](https://heaps.io/). Battle hardened on commerically successful titles and increasingly incorporates functional programming elements.

**Real FP!** - If you're a determined and brave functional programmer that insists on all the typeclasses, it's [Yampa](https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/Yampa).

**Best in class opensource!** - If you're looking for a more traditional game dev experience with an editor, aren't fussy about your language and want something opensource, you probably can't do better than [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).
