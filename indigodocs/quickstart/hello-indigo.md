This is a quick start tutorial to help you build something that does something, after which you can explore more advanced topics on your own.

## Choose your game API style

The first thing you have to do is choose is choose from either `IndigoSandbox`, `IndigoDemo` or `IndigoGame`, which briefly are:

1. Sandbox - The smallest API interface, nice for trying things out, doesn't scale as well and is missing some functionality.
2. Demo - Technically gives you access to everything, but doesn't provide Scene management (you'd have to roll your own).
3. Game - Like demo, but with Scene management built it.

We'll use `IndigoSandbox` for brevity, and that your game is called `helloindigo`.

## "Hello, Indigo!"

TODO: Build the example and put the relevant things here.

// Or not?
It is assumed that you have your [build tooling set up and ready to go](setup-and-configuration.md).
